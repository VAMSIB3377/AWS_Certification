Instance Store

	- Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives.
	- An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance.
	- An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance.
	- When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.


Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

	- Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances.
	- If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.
	- EBS volumes are for data that needs to persist.


Amazon EBS Snapshots

	- An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup.
	- Incremental backups are different from full backups, in which all the data in a storage volume copies each time a backup occurs. The full backup 
	  includes data that has not changed since the most recent backup.
