1_Introduction


--> Cloud Computing - Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
               	    - Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers
		      and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases,
		      on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS.


--> Other Name of On-Premises Deployment -- Private Cloud Deployment.

--> On-premises Deployment - On-premises deployment is when data is stored on your own servers, and you install and manage the software.

--> This Pay-as-You-go Pricing model will be very useful to the custometrs as they pay for what they use and they do not pay for what they do not use.
