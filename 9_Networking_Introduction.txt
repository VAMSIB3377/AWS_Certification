Subnet - A subnet is a range of IP Addresses in your VPC. You can attach AWS resources, such as EC2 instances and RDS DB insstances, to subnets.
       - Subnets are of 2 Types - 1> Public Subnet 
				- 2> Private Subnet


1> Public Subnet 

	- A Public subnet is a subnet that's associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet Gateway.

2> Private Subnet

	- Instances in the private subnet are backend servers that don't accept incoming traffic from the Internet and therefore do not have public IP Addresses.
	- But They can send the requests through NAT Gateway.
