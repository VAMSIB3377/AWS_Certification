- Serveless Computing

	- Here The Term "Serverless" means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers.

- AWS Lamba

	- AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers.
	- While using AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time that you consume.
	- Here's How AWS Lambda works
		- Upload Code to Lambda
		- Set Code to trigger from an event source
		- Code runs only when triggered
		- Pay only for the compute time you use


- Containers
