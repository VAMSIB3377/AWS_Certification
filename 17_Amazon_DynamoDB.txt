Non-Relational Databases

	- In a nonrelational database, you create tables. A table is a place where you can store and query data.
	- Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they use structures other than rows and columns to organize data.
	- One type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs.
	- In a key-value database, you can add or remove attributes from items in the table at any time.
	- Additionally, not every item in the table has to have the same attributes. 

DynamoDB

	- Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
	- Serverless 	     -- DynamoDB is serverless, which means that you do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers. 
			     -- You also do not have to install, maintain, or operate software.
	- Automatic Scaling  -- As the size of your database shrinks or grows, DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity while maintaining consistent performance.
