3_AWS_Organizations


- It is a Central Location to Manage Multiple AWS Accounts.
- Suppose that your company has multiple AWS accounts. You can use AWS Organizations to consolidate 
  and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central location.
- In AWS Organizations, you can centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization by using service control policies (SCPs).
- SCPs enable you to place restrictions on the AWS services, resources, and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access.


Organizational Units

	- In AWS Organizations, you can group accounts into organizational units (OUs) to make it easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements.
	- When you apply a policy to an OU, all the accounts in the OU automatically inherit the permissions specified in the policy.
