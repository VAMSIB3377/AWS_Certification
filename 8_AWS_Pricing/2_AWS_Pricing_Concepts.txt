2_AWS_Pricing_Concepts

	1> Pay for what You Use

		- For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.

	2> Pay Less When You Reserve

		- Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.

		- For example, suppose that your company is using Amazon EC2 instances for a workload that needs to run continuously.
		  You might choose to run this workload on Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans, because the plan allows you to save up to 72% over the equivalent On-Demand Instance capacity.

	3> Pay Less With Volume-Based Discounts When You Use More

		- Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

		- For example, the more Amazon S3 storage space you use, the less you pay for it per GB.



AWS Pricing Calculator

	- The AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. 

	- You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define.

	- A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.

	- In the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can enter details such as the kind of operating system you need, memory requirements, and input/output (I/O) requirements.

	- By using the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can review an estimated comparison of different EC2 instance types across AWS Regions.



AWS Pricing Examples

	- AWS Lambda

		- For AWS Lambda, you are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time that it takes for them to run.

		- AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.

	- Amazon EC2

		- With Amazon EC2, you pay for only the compute time that you use while your instances are running.

		- For some workloads, you can significantly reduce Amazon EC2 costs by using Spot Instances.

		- For example, suppose that you are running a batch processing job that is able to withstand interruptions.

		- Using a Spot Instance would provide you with up to 90% cost savings while still meeting the availability requirements of your workload.

	- Amazon S3

		- For Amazon S3 pricing, consider the following cost components: 1> Storage

										 2> Requests and Data Retreivals - You pay for requests made to your Amazon S3 objects and buckets.

										 3> Data Transfer - here is no cost to transfer data between different Amazon S3 buckets or from Amazon S3 to other services within the same AWS Region.
										    However, you pay for data that you transfer into and out of Amazon S3, with a few exceptions.

										 4> Management and Replication
