11_Subnets_Network_Access_Control_Lists

Subnets

	- A Subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private.
	- A Public Subnet contains resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store's website.
	- A Private Subnet Contains resources that should be accessible only through your private network, Such as a Database that contains customers personal info and order histories.
	- In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other.

Network Traffic in a VPC

	- When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is sent as a packet. A packet is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network.


Network access control lists (ACLs)

	- The VPC component that checks packet permissions for subnets is a network access control list (ACL).
	- A network access control list (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
	- Each AWS account includes a default network ACL. When configuring your VPC, you can use your account’s default network ACL or create custom network ACLs. 
	- By default, your account’s default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic, but you can modify it by adding your own rules.

Stateless Packet Filtering

	- Network ACLs perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound. 
	- When a packet response for that request comes back to the subnet, the network ACL does not remember your previous request. The network ACL checks the packet response against it
	  s list of rules to determine whether to allow or deny.
	- After a packet has entered a subnet, it must have its permissions evaluated for resources within the subnet, such as Amazon EC2 instances. 

Security groups

	- The VPC component that checks packet permissions for an Amazon EC2 instance is a security group.
	- A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.
	- By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. You can add custom rules to configure which traffic to allow or deny.

Stateful packet filtering

	- Security groups performs stateful packet filtering. They Remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.
